#UTHPortal server

Server side component of the UTHPortal application.

UTHPortal, currently in the planning and hacking stages, will be a mobile app to serve information about courses and the university in general, right to your smartphone.

The server side of the app gathers information from various sources, such as courses' webpages, the eClass platform and the mailing lists of the university, stores it to a database, and serves it as json files through a HTTP RESTful API.

A production of VolosHack, the hacker's group of University of Thessaly.
